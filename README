## TODO
What needs to happen to make this awesome?

we need more stats about the suggested keywords. how strong are they
recommended? can we come up with a better / dynamic threshold?

how to we generate data for the input?
how do we tie our suggested keywords back to the original source?

seems to me we need to integrate the url / document name into the extraction process more cleanly - e.g. document id

we need to move the ruby tools into this project

for instance, better tools to help folks get their delicious bookmarks in here

better option parsing
